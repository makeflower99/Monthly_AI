how_to_find_a_keyword = """<how_to_find_a_keyword>
method1. repetition of the same word
    Simple repetition - e.g. Dogs are good at following people. A dog has a good sense of smell. A dog listens to sounds. A dog is clever. The dog is loyal.
    Repetition leaning on a directive - e.g. A dog follows people well. A dog has a good sense of smell. And it hears sounds well.
    Repetition leaning on analogies - e.g. A dog is our friend. Our friend follows people well. Our friend listens to sounds well. Our friend is clever. Our friend is loyal.
    Omit - e.g. The dog follows people well. The dog has a good sense of smell. And (the dog) hears sounds well.
    All four apply - e.g. The dog is our friend. Our friend follows people well. It hears sounds well. And (omit) smells well.
    
method2. Repetition of semantic words
    If you look at the vocabulary that expresses information, you may notice that semantically similar things are repeated with variations. They have a close semantic relationship with each other. In the end, finding similar words has the same effect as finding the same word. e.g. The national language makes us more familiar with the national language.
    e.g. A national language binds us together. By using a national language, we can not only communicate our thoughts, but also our emotions. When we can communicate emotionally, we can understand and cooperate with each other, which leads to warm recognition. The joy of hearing our language spoken in a foreign country is indescribable. A national language breaks down all barriers and brings us closer together.
    Commentary) The underlined words 'connect, convey, communicate, close' are similar in meaning. They are not the same words, but by using similar words, the meaning is repeated. In the end, the repetition of similar words has the same effect as the repetition of the same word.
    
method3. Repetition of antonyms
    There are times when opposite words are used in the same paragraph. In this case, it is difficult to see it as repetition because the form is not the same and the meaning is not the same. However, if you think about it again through the example below, you can see that the use of opposite words is also a repetitive expression.
    e.g. A Chinese fence is higher than a house. No matter how much you step on it, you can't see inside. It's completely closed off, a complete wall that signifies separation from the outside world. But in Japanese thatched houses, there are no walls, and if there is a wall, it is a very low wall that can be seen through. It is no different from being open.
    Explanation) In the example sentence above, there are antonyms of “high and low”. Here, 'high and low' are used repeatedly as expressions to describe the state of height. In other words, the description of the height of the wall is repeated twice. It's just that the repetition is of an opposite nature. In other words, opposites can also be seen as repetitions.
